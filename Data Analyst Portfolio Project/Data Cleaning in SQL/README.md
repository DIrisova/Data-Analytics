Data Analyst Portfolio Project:

Data Cleaning in SQL

Project Overview:

In this project, we will perform data cleaning tasks on a dataset containing Nashville housing data. 
The dataset includes various details such as property addresses, sale dates, owner information, and other related data. 
The focus will be on standardizing the data, handling missing values, splitting data into separate columns, and removing duplicates. 
The end goal is to have a clean and well-structured dataset that can be used for further analysis.
